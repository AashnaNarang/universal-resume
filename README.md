**How to print or save it as a pdf?**  
Right-click -> Print.

**Does it support A4 and Letter paper sizes?**  
Yes, replace all *-letter classes with *-a4, uncomment specific media query, and theme screens config.

**What font does it use?**  
Per [Butterick’s](https://practicaltypography.com/) free fonts recommendations, I’ve chosen IBM Plex.

**Why it’s made?**  
I couldn’t find any formal and professional resume (CV) website with good typography, that is optimized for print, pdf, and mobile. Also, researching what recruiters want, my priorities were fast scanning time and all content to fit on one page. 

**What’s the status of its development?**  
Now, it’s in alpha phase. I’ll continue working on it almost daily, indefinitely.
